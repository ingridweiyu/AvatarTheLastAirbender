Our project was created by Dareen Atallah, Weiyu Huang, Peter Liu, and Vincent Robbins. Many, 
many hours and group meetings were held to get this project completed. At the very beginning 
we met and created the idea of the game and what each level will consist of, giving us all 
the same expectations of where to take our project each week. To point out who did what is 
very difficult because there was much collaboration. After each week each person’s newest 
code was merged together and resent out to the group allowing any member to edit and add 
and any features they liked to see or fix any features that were not working correctly.
 Everyone worked on all the files to make sure it was coded the best it can be.

The top three specs we spent the most time on in no particular order:

Dareen:
- Health mechanisms
- User experience and memory management
- Game design and documentation of functionality 

Weiyu:
- Basic functionality of game and object interaction
- Implementation of class hierarchy 
- Game graphics design and sound effects 

Peter:
- Boss level, enemy, and game mechanics/animations
- Optimization of class hierarchy
- Weekly merge and connection of members’ progress

Vince: 
- Program efficiency/computational complexity
- Input handling
- Player abilities
